# PAM-Password-Picker

This is a simple powershell script with a WPF GUI for fetching privileged accounts using REST API calls.

It is dependent on psPAS https://pspas.pspete.dev/ and running the application requires the PS Module to be installed and imported.

It is in initial dev phase, so issues :bug:, enhancements and feature requests are [more than welcome](https://github.com/GCON-GmbH/PAM-Password-Picker/issues) :raised_hands:
